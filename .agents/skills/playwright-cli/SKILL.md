# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Quick start

```bash
# open new browser
pnpm exec playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
pnpm exec playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e15
pnpm exec playwright-cli type "page.click"
pnpm exec playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
pnpm exec playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
```

## Commands

```

### DevTools

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli console
pnpm exec playwright-cli console warning
pnpm exec playwright-cli requests
pnpm exec playwright-cli request 5
pnpm exec playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
pnpm exec playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
pnpm exec playwright-cli tracing-start
pnpm exec playwright-cli tracing-stop
pnpm exec playwright-cli video-start video.webm
pnpm exec playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
pnpm exec playwright-cli video-stop

# annotate each subsequent action (click, type, ...) with a callout naming the action and highlighting the target
pnpm exec playwright-cli video-show-actions --duration=600 --position=top-right
pnpm exec playwright-cli video-hide-actions

# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
pnpm exec playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
pnpm exec playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style
pnpm exec playwright-cli highlight e5
pnpm exec playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
# hide a single element highlight, or all page highlights when no target is given
pnpm exec playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
pnpm exec playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e5
pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
pnpm exec playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --mobile
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
pnpm exec playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
pnpm exec playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
pnpm exec playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
pnpm exec playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
pnpm exec playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
pnpm exec playwright-cli delete-data
```

## URLs with `&` on Windows

On Windows, `cmd.exe` and PowerShell treat `&` as a command separator, so URLs with multiple query parameters get truncated before `playwright-cli` runs. Escape `&` with `^&` in `cmd.exe`, or use `--%` in PowerShell:

```batch
pnpm exec playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1^&b=2"
```

```powershell
pnpm exec playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> pnpm exec playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot --boxes

# search a large snapshot instead of capturing it all — returns matching nodes
# with 3 lines of context around each match (like grep -C)
pnpm exec playwright-cli find "Add to cart"
pnpm exec playwright-cli find --regex "\\$[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{2}"
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
pnpm exec playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
pnpm exec playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
pnpm exec playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
pnpm exec playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

pnpm exec playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
pnpm exec playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
pnpm exec playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Project command

This project exact-pins `@playwright/cli`. Run every browser-automation command as `pnpm exec playwright-cli <command>`; never install or invoke it globally. The CLI may warn that this project-local adaptation differs from its bundled generic skill; do not run `pnpm exec playwright-cli install --skills=agents`, because that would overwrite the required pnpm commands.

## Example: Form submission

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot

pnpm exec playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
pnpm exec playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e3
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli open https://example.com
pnpm exec playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
pnpm exec playwright-cli tab-list
pnpm exec playwright-cli tab-select 0
pnpm exec playwright-cli snapshot
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli open https://example.com
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e4
pnpm exec playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
pnpm exec playwright-cli console
pnpm exec playwright-cli requests
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
```

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli open https://example.com
pnpm exec playwright-cli tracing-start
pnpm exec playwright-cli click e4
pnpm exec playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
pnpm exec playwright-cli tracing-stop
pnpm exec playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
pnpm exec playwright-cli open https://example.com
pnpm exec playwright-cli show --annotate
```
